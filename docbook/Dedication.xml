    This book is dedicated to the loving memories of Seth Vidal and
    Donald Brewer.

  <para>
    Seth, you were the kind of person who always stuck to what they
    believed in once they decided what that was. There are few people
    you can truly say that about. Your creativity and technical
    prowess changed the world in ways most people couldn't dream
    of. It's a tragedy we lost you so early, but I can promise you one
    thing: your contributions to the world were inspirational and it's
    going to take a lot of people to pick up where you left off.

  <para>
    As you used to say, Don, <emphasis>lemme be honest
    wit'cha</emphasis>.... You were always a stand up gentleman, sharp
    as a tack, and loyal as hell to anyone you were responsible
    for. You may be gone now, but you will never be forgotten by those
    who knew you.
