    Donald Brewer.

    You were a man who always stuck to what he believed in once he
    decided what that was. There are few people you can truly say that
    about. Your creativity and technical prowess changed the world in
    ways most people couldn't dream of. It's a tragedy we lost you so
    early, but I can promise you one thing: your contributions to the
    world were inspirational and it's going to take a lot of people to
    pick up where you left off.

    As you used to say, Don, <emphasis>lemme be honest
    wit'cha</emphasis>.... You were always a stand up gentleman, sharp
    as a tack, and loyal as hell to anyone you were responsible
    for. You may be gone now, but you will never be forgotten.
