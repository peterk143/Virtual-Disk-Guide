  <title>The Virtual Disk Cookbook</title>

  <para>
    In this section we're just going to cover things you'll find
    yourself needing to do from time to time. It's assumed that you're
    comfortable with the concepts already and don't need everything
    explained. Theory and concepts will be covered later on in <xref
    linkend="VDG-Concepts"/>.
