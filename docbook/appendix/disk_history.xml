  <title>Appendix: Disk Drive History</title>

  <para>
    Disk drives, and how they are accessed, is a broad subject which
    has changed greatly over time. Some <quote>facts</quote> are
    actually just misconceptions which are taken as canon. This
    section will attempt to sort the facts from fiction and give some
    sort of historical account of how the software and hardware has
    changed over time.
