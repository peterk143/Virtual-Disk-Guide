    <para>
      I was motivated to write this book because I felt the quality
      of the information regarding commonly used functionality in
      virtual disk operation was lacking certain specific clear
      examples. The information that is available is not contained
      in a central location. Some concepts of the qemu system aren't
      covered at all. FAQs lead on to having an answer to a
      particular query, but many lead you to off site resources,
      some of which are no longer available on the Internet.
    </para>

    <para>
      What I hope to provide is a book which will demonstrate the
      core concepts of virtual disk management. This book will
      concern itself primarily with the <command>qemu-img</command>
      tool and common GNU/Linux disk utility tools like
      <command>fdisk</command>, <command>parted</command>, and
      <command>resize2fs</command>. Most importantly to me, in the
      case of non-trivial examples, I hope to identify what the
      relevant technical concepts are and how they work up to the
      final result of each example.

    <title>Units &amp; Prefixes</title>

    <para>
      Throughout this book you will see file sizes specified with an
      assortment of units. For example: 42 kB, 42 Mb, 42 GiB, 42 G, 42 GiB.
    </para>

    <para>
      Without an explanation this may seem confusing, random, and
      inconsistent. However, there is a method to this madness:

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The unit used in discussion preceding/following an example
            is consistent with the convention used in the example
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Without any scope or context, binary prefixes are used
            (e.g., 1024 KiB, 35565 MiB)
          </para>
        </listitem>

      Tim Bielawa (or <firstterm>Shaggy</firstterm> if you knew him in
      college) has been a system administrator since his humble
      beginnings in 2007. Back then he was working in the Systems
      Staff Group in the West Virginia University Computer Science
      Department.
    </para>

    <para>
      Now-a-days Tim works at Red Hat, Inc., makers of Red Hat
      Enterprise Linux, and sponsors of the Fedora Project. Tim has
      been involved in Open Source communities for around a decade,
      and a contributor/maintainer for about half that time. In his
      spare time he enjoys writing documentation

      <package>bitmath</package> is a Python library Tim wrote which
      simplifies a lot of work required to manipulate (add, subtract,
      convert) prefix units (MiB, kB, TB, etc). Much of the
      inspiration for writing the <package>bitmath</package> library
      came directly from working on this
      book. <package>bitmath</package> is loaded with features:
      converting between units, arithmetic, best human-readable
      representation, rich comparison, sorting, the list of features
      goes on. Check out the bitmath docs
