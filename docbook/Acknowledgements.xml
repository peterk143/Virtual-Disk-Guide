  <title>Acknowledgments</title>

  <para>
    How do you write a proper acknowledgements section? I've never had
    to do one of these before.

    This book wouldn't have been possible without the gracious advice,
    support, and patience of several individuals.

    Finally, my biggest "thanks" goes to David Krovich. A mentor,
    friend, and button-pusher for many years now. You always
    encouraged me to be better than I was. Without the opportunities
    you offered me, and the radical influence you had on my life, this
    book would never have even reached conception. It was while
    working under your instruction that I discovered my passion for
    documenting everything I learned.
