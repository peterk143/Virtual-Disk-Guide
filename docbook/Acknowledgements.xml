    This book wouldn't have been possible without the gracious advice,
    support, and patience of several individuals.

    Thanks to John Eckersberg and Chris Venghaus for copious amounts
    of feedback early on. It really helped to stoke my fire and get
    things moving. And a special thanks to Chris for being my biggest
    word-of-mouth referral. I have no idea how you meet all these
    people with burning needs to have their virtual disk questions
    answered, but I'm glad you refer them to me when you do.

    Jorge FÃ¡bregas, you were a fabulous unexpected resource when most
    of the major writing was happening for this book. Thanks for
    repeatedly reaching out to me with your feedback and suggestions
    and pointing out errors. This book is better because of your
    unique contributions.

    To my wife, Alicia, thanks for making me so happy and keeping me
    sane. Thank you for encouraging me to work on this book when I
    didn't want to. And, thank you for <firstterm>everything
    else</firstterm>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Finally, my biggest <quote>thanks</quote> goes to David Krovich. A
    mentor, friend, and button-pusher for many years now. You always
    encouraged me to be better than I was. Without the opportunities
    you offered me, and the radical influence you had on my life, this
    book would never have even reached conception. Truth be told,
    <xref linkend="VDG-Cookbook"/> section is mostly a merge and
    refresh of a lot of the notes I took, and staff documentation I
    wrote, working on one of our provisioning projects. Those notes
    became the first chapters of this book.
  </para>

  <para>
    It was while working under your instruction that I discovered my
    passion for documenting everything I learned. This book is a
    testament to that passion. Thanks, Kro.
