difficulty spectrum, from the basic printing of a disk's meta-data, to
cloning physical disks into virtual disks. Disk format conversion and
disk resizing are both covered in-depth.

Topics include, the Virtual disk cookbook, helper utilities, disk
formats, troubleshooting, and performance considerations.

The Linux Sysadmin's Guide to Virtual Disks is written in a tone that
is approachable to both newcomers, and experienced veterans.  No
